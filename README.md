## Overview
Scratch for Machine Learning: a hands-on, visual platform to teach foundational machine learning (ML) concepts through experimentation and play. Unlike existing low-code/no-code tools that prioritize outcomes over understanding, this product emphasizes conceptual clarity while allowing users to see their ideas in action.

## Key features:
- A block-based interface inspired by Scratch, tailored for building ML models.
- An emphasis on the why and how behind ML concepts, avoiding abstraction that hides the logic.
- Challenge focused on classification and prediction

Target Audience: Users with basic mathematical and programming fluency seeking to deepen their conceptual understanding of ML.
